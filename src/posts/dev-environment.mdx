This is not a post about ecology but rather a post about the struggles I face when trying to
handle multiple development environments. It's a common problem for developers who work on
multiple projects with different requirements. This article will cover some of the tools and
techniques I use to manage my development environments and make my life easier.

## Why is it a struggle?

When you work on multiple projects, you often have to deal with different versions of libraries,
frameworks, and tools. This can lead to conflicts and compatibility issues that can be hard to
resolve. For example, you might have one project that requires Python 2.7 and another that requires Python 3.x.
If you try to run both projects on the same machine, you'll run into problems because the two versions of Python
are not compatible with each other. This is just one example of the many issues that can arise when
dealing with multiple development environments. And the struggles varies alot depending on the
technologies you use. I have worked with a lot of different technologies and I can tell you that
each one has its own set of challenges.

## Tools and Techniques

I will first talk from my tech stack perspective, then I will talk about the most common tools and techniques
I know about. I will also try to give you some tips on how to use them effectively.

### The Python struggles

Python is my goto language for scripts, automation and quick prototyping. As a CTF player, I often have to deal with
different versions of Python and different libraries. There are many tools to handle Python environments, but
I found a VSCode extension called [Python Environment Manager](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python-environment-manager)
that is based on `pyenv` and `virtualenv`. It allows you to create and manage virtual environments directly from VSCode.
As from python 3.12 using virtual environments is now the default way to manage Python projects it even became a
necessity. A quick google search will give you a lot of resources on how to use `pyenv` and `virtualenv` the
two most popular and straightforward tools for managing Python environments. For other tools I want to be available
globally I use `pipx`. Some people like to use `conda` but It is a bit overkill for small projects.
Anyway, One classic thing is to use `pip freeze > requirements.txt` to save your dependencies
and `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install them. This is common good practice among python devs which
reduces the struggles. About working with Python2 no one is doing that anymore, but if you have to this
dinosaur is still around and can be installed with `pyenv` too.

### The Node.js struggles

Node.js is nowadays hard to avoid, especially if you are a web developer. It is used for
everything from front-end development to back-end development. The struggles with Node.js are mostly
related to package management and versioning. The most common tool for managing Node.js environments is `nvm`
(Node Version Manager). It allows you to install and manage multiple versions of Node.js on your machine.
You can switch between versions easily and it works well with `npm` (Node Package Manager) and `yarn`.
You can also use `npx` to run packages without installing them globally. This is useful for running scripts
or tools that you don't want to install permanently. Just use nvm and you might be fine.

### The Android studio struggles

Well, Android development is a whole different beast. The struggles here are mostly related to version conflicts
among everything. I used to do native Android development with Java and Kotlin, but now I mostly use Flutter.
Flutter is a great framework for cross-platform development, but it has its own set of challenges.
The main struggle is managing the different versions of Flutter and Dart. The best way I found so far
to manage multiple Flutter are tools called [Puro](https://puro.dev/) and [fvm](https://fvm.app/). Very similar
but Puro is more recent and has a better integration with VSCode.

Also, [Flutter Migrate](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/blob/master/docs/wiki_archive/Flutter-migrate.md) might
be useful if you are migrating from an old version of Flutter to a new one. It helps you update your code
to the latest version of Flutter and Dart. It is a bit of a hassle to use, but it can save you a lot of time
in the long run. If you are using Android Studio, you can use the built-in
`SDK Manager` to manage your Android SDK versions...ish

### Docker and Containers

Our savior! Docker is a great tool for managing development environments. It allows you to create
containers that can run on any machine, regardless of the underlying operating system.
You can create a container for each project and specify the dependencies and tools you need.
This way, you can avoid conflicts and compatibility issues. Docker also allows you to share your
containers with others, which is great for collaboration. You can use Docker Compose to define and run
multi-container applications. This is especially useful for web development, where you might need
a database, a web server, and an application server all running together. Docker is a powerful tool that can help you manage your development environments and make your life easier.
However, it has a learning curve and can be a bit overwhelming at first.
There are many resources available online to help you get started with Docker and Docker Compose.
I recommend checking out the official documentation and some tutorials to get familiar with the basics.

### Other Tools and Techniques

There are many other tools and techniques that can help you manage your development environments.
Here are some of the most common ones:

- **Virtual Machines**: You can use virtual machines to create isolated environments for your projects.
  Tools like VirtualBox and VMware allow you to create and manage virtual machines easily.
- **Vagrant**: Vagrant is a tool that allows you to create and manage virtual machines.
